** This module will not work with any version of web2project prior to v3.0-pre! **

The Risk Management Module is a simple module that allows Users to log issues - or potential issues - against Projects or Tasks and attach notes/logs until the issue is resolved or mitigated.

It does not conform to the Project Management Book of Knowledge (PMBOK)'s Risk Management Process but does assist in tracking the results of the Identification stage, assisting in the Quantitative Risk Analysis, and the Risk Monitoring.  Feedback in improving the module and more closely adhering to this process is welcome.

COMPATIBLE VERSIONS

=====================================

*  v2.0+ of this module has been validated to work with web2project v3.0-pre and above and is known to be incompatible with earlier releases.

*  If you are using any version of web2project prior to this, please upgrade as soon as possible to address various security, usability, and functionality issues.

*  This won't work with dotProject, don't even bother trying.

Changelog
=====================================

2.0 Major rewrite using core web2project v3.0 functionality

-  Updated the setup class to take advantage of new w2p_Core_Setup functionality; 
-  Renamed the CRiskNotes class to CRisk_Notes to take advantage of our autoloader;
-  Updated all classes (CRisk and CRiskNotes) to take advantage of the pre/post hooks, this allowed us to eliminate the store() and delete() methods;
-  Updated all controllers (do_risk_aed.php and do_risk_note_aed.php) to use the w2p_Controllers_Base class;
-  Updated the List and View views to use the HTMLHelper;
-  Deleted lots of code;


KNOWN/PREVIOUS ISSUES

=====================================

Open Issues:

*  The CRisk->hook_preStore() method has a hardcoded Magic Number.  The RiskStatus of 2 is assumed to be "Closed" and when a Risk is updated to have this value, the Mitigation Date will be calculated and stored.  Moving out of this state will clear the Mitigation Date.  At a later point, this Magic Number should be removed.

*  Additional reporting functionality would be useful.  Feedback in improving this module's reporting and more closely adhering to this process is welcome.

Planned:

*  Additional reporting!

*  Support for the Custom Field Editor within core Web2Project.

*  The module should be scrubbed of the inline html/php nastiness.
